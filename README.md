# MaceNotes


[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/open-source.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)
**MaceNotes is a website where students can contribute and get notes and learn more from people you trust.** 


## Project Background

Eventhough platforms providing lecture notes are there, notes are not updated according to the latest syllabus and does not contains the whole portion. MaceNotes is a one-stop solution for all these problems. It serves as a platform where students can get Lecture Notes arranged according to their brach and year so they can prepare for exam in one night.

## Areas of Collaboration 👨

Project Managers, Developers, and Designers would be collaborating on various domains like:

-   **UI Prototyping** with figma tool [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/zHfpGg2HLJxtMoOxJK1MzG/MaceNotes?node-id=0%3A1).
    
-    **Front-End Development with ReactJS**
    
This would be an enriching experience for all Student Developers, Project Managers, and Designers.
